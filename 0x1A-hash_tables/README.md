0x1A. C - Hash tables

MANDATORY TASKS

0. Write a function that creates a hash table.
1. Write a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm.
2. Write a function that gives you the index of a key.
3. Write a function that adds an element to the hash table.
4. Write a function that retrieves a value associated with a key.
5. Write a function that prints a hash table.
6. Write a function that deletes a hash table.


ADVANCED TASK

7. In PHP, hash tables are ordered. Waitâ€¦ WAT? How is this even possible?
	Before you continue, please take a moment to think about it: how you would implement it if you were asked to during an interview or a job. What data structures would you use? How would it work?
For this task, please:



Read PHP Internals Book: HashTable

Use the same hash function

Use these data structures:

Rewrite the previous functions using these data structures:



shash_table_t *shash_table_create(unsigned long int size);

int shash_table_set(shash_table_t *ht, const char *key, const char *value);

The key/value pair should be inserted in the sorted list at the right place

Note that here we do not want to do exactly like PHP: we want to create a sorted linked list, by key (sorted on ASCII value), that we can print by traversing it. See example.

char *shash_table_get(const shash_table_t *ht, const char *key);

void shash_table_print(const shash_table_t *ht);

Should print the hash table using the sorted linked list

void shash_table_print_rev(const shash_table_t *ht);

Should print the hash tables key/value pairs in reverse order using the sorted linked list

void shash_table_delete(shash_table_t *ht);

You are allowed to have more than 5 functions in your file
